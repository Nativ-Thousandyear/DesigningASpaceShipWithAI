Designing a space station that orbits like the ISS (International Space Station) involves several key considerations, including structural design, orbital mechanics, life support systems, communication, and more. Here's a high-level overview of how you might start designing a space station that orbits like the ISS:

Mission Objectives:
Define the primary objectives of the space station. Is it for scientific research, technology development, human spaceflight, or a combination of these? Identify the specific goals you want to achieve with the station.

Orbit Selection:
Choose the desired orbit for your space station. The ISS orbits in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of approximately 420 kilometers (260 miles). You'll need to consider factors such as altitude, inclination, and orbital period.

Structural Design:
Design the structure of the space station to withstand the harsh environment of space, including microgravity, radiation, and thermal fluctuations. Consider using modular designs that allow for expansion and upgrades.

Life Support Systems:
Develop life support systems to provide air, water, and waste management for the crew onboard. These systems must be reliable and sustainable for long-duration missions.

Power Generation:
Design efficient solar power systems to provide energy for the station's operations, including scientific experiments, communication, and life support.

Communication:
Establish a robust communication system for data transmission between the station and ground control. Consider the use of high-frequency radio, data relay satellites, and other communication technologies.

Docking and Resupply:
Plan for docking and resupply capabilities, similar to how the ISS receives cargo from spacecraft like the SpaceX Dragon or Russian Soyuz.

Crew Accommodations:
Design living quarters for the crew, including sleeping quarters, food storage, exercise facilities, and workspaces for scientific research.

Scientific Research:
Identify the types of scientific experiments and research that will be conducted onboard the station. Allocate space and resources for these activities.

Safety and Contingency Planning:
Develop safety protocols, emergency procedures, and contingency plans to address potential risks, such as micrometeoroid impacts, system failures, or medical emergencies.

Sustainability and Longevity:
Ensure that the station's design allows for maintenance, upgrades, and repairs to extend its operational life.

Collaboration and Funding:
Explore collaboration opportunities with international space agencies, research organizations, and private companies. Secure funding for the project through government support, private investments, or other means.

Remember that designing a space station is a complex endeavor that requires expertise in various fields, including aerospace engineering, orbital mechanics, and systems integration. Collaboration with experienced professionals and organizations in the space industry is essential for the success of such a project.
